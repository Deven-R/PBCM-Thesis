Priority-based consensus mechanism (PBCM) is a novel consensus mechanism proposed in the report to
be used by an organisation as part of their internal transaction management system. The mechanism
integrates Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) with a dynamic grouping mechanism based upon
the priority of the transactions in the system. The following paper analyses the predominant state-of-art
consensus mechanisms that exist both in public and private domains and uses insights from the analysis
to guide various design choices of the novel mechanism. To validate the proposed protocol, the project
employs mathematical modelling, simulation of data and implementation within the Hyperledger Fabric
platform to assess the mechanism's practicality and optimise performance in metrics including a
transaction's size, latency and incentives for nodes. The outcomes of the analysis reveal a promising
improvement in PBFT thereby enhancing the efficiency and meeting the requirements set by the
organisation. PBCM provides innovative solutions to the organisation as it can manage transactions
according to their significance to the company, whilst maintaining network throughput and aligned
business objectives.
